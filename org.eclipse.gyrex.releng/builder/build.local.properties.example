# Local Build Properties
# ----------------------
#
#   Note, this file only exists locally. It's read by builder to set local 
#   build options such as paths.
#
#   Save as "build.local.properties" and adjust the paths to suit your needs.
#
#   IMPORTANT: Please don't use backslash (\) on Windows. It might cause issues with
#              mixed path names in Ant.
